# Incident Postmortem: Database Outage on March 15, 2025

## Issue Summary
- **Duration**: March 15, 2025 14:00 UTC to March 15, 2025 16:00 UTC

- **Impact**: The database went down, affecting 95% of users who attempted to 
  access product details on the website. Users experienced errors such as 
  "Service Unavailable" when trying to view product information. This caused 
  significant disruption in the shopping experience for our customers. We 
  could almost hear them crying "WHY, INTERNET, WHY?"

- **Root Cause**: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration during a routine 
  database update, which led to a failure in connecting the application to 
  the database server. The issue was a result of an incorrect setting in the 
  database configuration file, which was overlooked during deployment.

## Timeline
- **14:00 UTC**: Monitoring system alerted due to high response times observed 
  on the database server. The system sent an automatic incident notification 
  to the engineering team via PagerDuty. Cue panic mode.

- **14:05 UTC**: The on-call engineer acknowledged the alert and started to 
  investigate the issue. Initial checks pointed to high CPU usage on the 
  database server, which was suspected to be the root cause.

- **14:10 UTC**: A deeper investigation revealed that the issue was not related 
  to CPU usage but instead to the database connection issues, as several 
  services failed to connect to the database. Debugging: Engaged.

- **14:15 UTC**: Logs from the database server were reviewed, and it was 
  discovered that the connection pool was exhausted due to an incorrect 
  configuration in the database settings. The update script had 
  unintentionally overwritten a critical configuration file. Oops.

- **14:30 UTC**: At this point, the on-call engineer escalated the issue to the 
  senior database engineer for a second opinion. The senior engineer confirmed 
  the misconfiguration and began working on restoring the correct configuration.

- **14:45 UTC**: The database configuration file was rolled back to its previous 
  version, and a restart of the database service was initiated. The database 
  started to stabilize, and services began to recover.

- **15:00 UTC**: The database service was fully restored, and initial tests 
  showed that connections were successful. Users could access product info 
  again (cue customer happiness).

- **16:00 UTC**: The incident was officially closed after monitoring systems 
  confirmed that the system was stable and user traffic was returning to 
  normal levels. The engineering team sighed with relief.

## Root Cause and Resolution
- **Root Cause**: The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the 
  database connection settings that occurred during a routine update process. 
  Specifically, a configuration file was incorrectly overwritten by an 
  automated deployment process, which led to connection failures between the 
  web application and the database. This issue was not caught during the 
  initial testing phase because the test environment did not reflect the 
  production environment's traffic load and configuration setup.

- **Resolution**: The issue was resolved by restoring the correct configuration 
  file from the backup and restarting the database service. This allowed the 
  application to reconnect to the database successfully. We also identified 
  that additional monitoring on the database connection settings should be 
  added to prevent similar issues in the future. The misconfigured update 
  script was reviewed, and steps were taken to improve the deployment pipeline 
  to prevent accidental overwrites of critical configuration files.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
- **Things to improve/fix**:
    - Implement a more robust version control system for configuration files 
      to prevent accidental overwrites during updates.
    - Conduct a thorough review of the deployment process to ensure proper 
      rollback mechanisms are in place for critical systems like the database.
    - Improve the monitoring of database server metrics, specifically for 
      connection pool exhaustion and related errors.
    - Enhance testing environments to better replicate production load 
      conditions, ensuring that configuration changes are validated before 
      deployment.
  
- **Tasks**:
    - **Task 1**: Review and update the deployment script to prevent overwriting 
      of critical configuration files. Implement safeguards and rollback 
      features for database-related configurations.
    - **Task 2**: Add automated tests for the database configuration and 
      deployment scripts to ensure the correct settings are applied in all 
      environments.
    - **Task 3**: Implement additional monitoring on the database connection 
      pool, setting up alerts for exhaustion of available connections, which 
      could serve as an early warning.
    - **Task 4**: Create a comprehensive guide for handling database outages, 
      outlining specific steps for recovery and mitigation.
    - **Task 5**: Conduct a post-incident review with all relevant teams to 
      ensure that the steps taken to resolve the issue are documented and 
      understood for future reference. Ensure all engineers are aware of the 
      importance of testing configuration changes thoroughly.
